# JET Coding Test

## MVP / Checklist âœ…
* Show first 10 results of restaurants with ability to change this when user changes postcode, with following info on each restaurant "card":
    - Name
    - Cuisines
    - Rating
    - Address

* README with information on:
    - how to build, compile, run project
    - any assumptions or unclear points on project
    - any improvements you would make to your solution
    - Send github link/deployed webapp URL

## Tech Stack ðŸ¤–
*â€‹ JavaScript:
    - JS runs natively in browsers, no extra compiling needed (like python)
    - JS works both on server and browser (no need to switch languages on backend and frontend i.e. 
      TypeScript), keeping things time efficient
      
*â€‹ Node.js

*â€‹ Next.js:
    - SSR reduces load/pressure on client-side, making it great for scalability/handling potentially large 
      datasets -> great for scalability
    - Helps Developers: file-based routing makes it easy to know what you're affecting (i.e. just a 
      component? 
      Name of endpoint?), hot module replacement allows devs to see their changes
    - Optimises webapp by loading only what is needed
    - Easy deployment through Vercel
    x Using React.js would require an API layer Express, or Axios, leading to performance issues.
    x Manual routing setup in React is less efficient than Next.js
    
*â€‹ Tailwind CSS:
     - Fast styling, avoids extra CSS files
     - Only loads styles in use, reduces CSS bloating
     - Easy-to-read and makes mobile-first/desktop design consistent
     
*â€‹ Deploy on Vercel - built for Next.js
